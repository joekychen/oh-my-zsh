f | gradle.plugin.zsh | g | 4.2K |  | Matthew Git McCullough | matthewm@ambientideas.com | 1313080067 |  | Added a gradle build tool plugin  * Enhanced gradle plugin to parse tasks from a quick execution of the tool * Added a duplicated function for gradlew completion that uses gradlew internally. Builds like Gradle itself (built with Gradle) are sensitive to being run with a matching gradlew version. * Fixed broken caching of gradle task names. Added - and -- argument completions.
